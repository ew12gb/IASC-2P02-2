# Taken & Given

For the following project I decided to take a closer look at Johanna Druckers ‘Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display’.Druckers article touches upon tools that the digital humanities have adopted to help visualize their work. We are also introduced to data and capta, two terms that share base similarities in that they are both tools of receiving information. User R_BAIG touches on the subject and does great job of explaining differences between data and capta. "data is supposed to be a sort of “given.” For example, somebody runs a mile and you time them with a stop-watch, and once they finish, you measured their time as 4 minutes and 14 seconds, that data is given to you. On the other hand, capta is “taken” actively. To me, I would classify “capta” as what is used in the process of creating a visual representation of such thing, using data to aid in the creation." (R_Baig).
Data vs Capta was new to me, and I agreed that a given can be also set on a personal ideology as the taken has a fine line of being a little more unbiased. Therefore, I choose to use the following voyant-tools. The first one being a Cirrus, this tool would give me a re-occurring words in the article. The purpose of this tool is to give the reader a better understanding of the core topic of Druckers work. This tool could be classified as capta since I am directly taking these visual representations by a program from the source. From the many words that were given I decided to choose a select few that I thought represented Duckers work better for me. This is an example of data due to the visualization being generated from a given instead of a taken. 

Everyone has a different way of viewing an item, if it’s a food or a text the way this item is interpreted is always going to be different. Stephen Ramsay touches on this in his book ‘Reading Machines’.
“By one definition of the term, "deformation" suggests nothing more than
the basic textual maneuvers by which form gives way to form-the "de"
functioning not as a privative, but as relatively straightforward signifier of
change. But any reading that undertakes such changes (as all reading must)
remains threatened with the possibility that deformation signals loss, corruption,
and illegitimacy. Even now, in our poststructuralist age, we speak of
"faithfulness" to a text, of “flawed" or "misguided" readings, but any marking
of a text, any statement that is not are-performance of a statement, must break
faith with the ability of the text to mean and re-guide form into alternative intelligibilities” (Ramsay) 
Both Ducker and Ramsay agree on that text and data can be misguided by alternative intelligibilities, meaning that each individual person will decide on choosing different samples of data or text depending on how their mind works to make a topic stand out.

(Figure 1) One of the points Ducker makes in her work is that in the changing forms of knowledge and representations of knowledge we must focus on adapting to it appropriately. The following Cirrus us a visual representation on the key elements Duckers work will be focusing on. Some words that stand out and should be considered are: Graphical, Information, Knowledge, Display, Data, Humanistic, and Time. The following words give the viewer a solid sense in what one could expect the main topic to be when reading Duckers article. This visualization was taken directly from her article which it then chooses the most re-occurring words and post them, either making them bolder and bigger depending on their frequency. This could also be a visual representation of capta since this was directly taken from duckers work as opposed to being manually inputed by an individual.

(Figure 2) The final figure shows five select words that I decided represented Duckers work more accurately to me on a personal account.  Although there could be many factors on what influenced me to choose the following words there are a few that I know of. The amount spent reading a certain portion of text could have stuck with me better than a different portion. In class discussions on certain topics of the text, as well as portions that interested me more than others played a vital role in my ability to recall them. This visual representation is an example of data since I directly gave it the information to display instead of taking the information from an already given source. If this visual representation was to be completed by all of my peers in the 2P02 course the chosen combination of words would line up differently for each individual. Being independent beings with different ideologies would encourage each person to choose a different combination of words that personally stood out to them.
